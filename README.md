**🗄️ Databases Journey**

Welcome to my Databases repository, where I document my learning, hands-on experiments, and projects related to database management. This repository covers relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis), and cloud-based database solutions.

**📌 About This Repository**

This repository serves as a structured guide to database design, normalization, indexing, query optimization, transactions, and security. I’ll be working on real-world applications, exploring concepts like replication, sharding, and scalability, while sharing best practices and performance optimizations.

**🛠 Technologies Used**

MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite

MongoDB, Redis, Firebase

Cloud Databases (AWS RDS, Azure Cosmos DB, Google Firestore)

SQL Queries, Indexing, Transactions
